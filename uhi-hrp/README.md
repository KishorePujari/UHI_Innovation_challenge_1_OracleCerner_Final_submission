# uhi-hrp


* Assumptions*

Since we do not have end points available

We have developed this node.js code to mimic the servers

All the return data can be changed as per UHI, for now we have considered what is needed for this demo.

To change the basic raw data use file HRPInfo.json

*to run the project*

npm i
node index.js
